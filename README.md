# GulpBasedResponivePage

As we know wikipedia.org portal are majorly based on gulp pipelines build so i tried to learn them by making this simple Responsive page.
In this project i have learn to write code on gulp. I have used some modules and plugins used by wikipedia.org to build this project. 
Modules I used in this project are:-
Compile-handlebar(to compile all handlebar in to single index.handlebar and convert it into index.html)
svgSprites(to compile all different svgSprities into a single spirites)
postcss(to compile all differnt css into one postCss)
watch(to watch if any change event occures in handlebar , css and js recompile them again respectively) )
